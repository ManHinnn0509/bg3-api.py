# bg3-api.py

An API for BG3 modding (Custom items), I don't think this project can help on 3D modding

This project's size is around `288~340 MB` because I included the `lsx` files

**I can't guarantee this project is good cause I'm new to FastAPI and I only used it on browser (Clicking the links only)**

## The .env file

Yes I included it too because it's like a setting file in here, no personal infos etc, I might change it to a Python file in the future
